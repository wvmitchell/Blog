title: Pushing to the Finish

As we get close to the finish here at gSchool, the distractions are starting to
pile up. While everyone here is committed to becoming better at their craft, the
prospect of finding a job has moved to the front of most of our minds. One of
the unfortunate consequences of this is a general decrease in project
productivity, and to a lesser extent, overall learning.

I have been frustrated over the last couple weeks, as my own learning had seemed
to have stagnated. As I see it, the reasons for this are two fold. I'm not a fan
of excuses, however my health has been a major reason for the lag in my
productivity. Looking around at the class, I'd say I'm not alone in this, as
many of us are finally recovering from a nasty flu that spread throughout the
building. Furthermore, I have spread myself too thin on projects as of late,
trying to improve at a wide range of tasks, rather than drilling down on
a specific aspect.

With this in mind, my goals over this next three weeks are simple, if not
totally within my control. I would like to maintain my health, put forth a solid
effort on both the current services project and final mastery project, and get
a job.
