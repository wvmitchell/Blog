Alright, so before I even get started here, I've got to make some
disclosures. Not 'somebody is paying me for these words' disclosures
mind you, but more 'please don't comment rage on my words'. Ok, so I
want to make clear, I'm a fan of Javascript. Mostly, all of the cool
things you can do in a web browser with it. Paired with CSS3, the
animations you can pull off are downright impressive these days, and
that's awesome.

There is just one problem: I don't really like writing Javascript.

See, I spend most of my time writing Ruby, and I love it. Javascript
still has all these braces and semicolons. Then, wait, my fuction isn't
in the right place. I'll need to hoist that. Grumble.

Ok, yes, I can, and should, be using coffeescript. Yes, that's better,
much better. It feels more like ruby, pushes a little harder on the OOP
that I know and love. However it's still not Ruby.

So what is programmer to do? Enter <a href='http://opalrb.org' target='_blank'>Opal</a>

What is Opal? Well, in a nutshell it's pretty simple. In the same way
that Coffeescript compiles into Javascript, Opal compiles Ruby into
Javascript. Sound cool? It is. Read on.
