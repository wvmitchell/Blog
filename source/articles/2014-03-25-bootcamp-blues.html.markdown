Last night meeting with the new gSchool class in Boulder, I was asked the
question 'Do you think there is a stigma attached to people coming out of
development bootcamps, and if so how do you overcome that while looking for
jobs?' This is something that I've given considerable thought to in the weeks
since gSchool, and it's something that anyone taking part in a developer
training program ought to be asking themselves.

The reality is, yes, there is unquestionably a stigma attached to developers
coming out of bootcamps. However, just like any educational system, not all
bootcamps are created equal, and it's not fair to compare someone who has been
programming for six weeks with someone who has been programming for six months.
While you may not be able to change the minds of every developer you meet, there
are some simple things you can do to help overcome the challenges of being a new
developer.

In talking to senior developers at meetups around town, the single biggest gripe
they seem to have about the bootcamps is the attitude they feel it breeds. If
you're going into one of these programs expecting to learn everything you'll
ever need to know about programming, you're fundamentally misunderstanding the
field you're getting into. There is always a new technology to try out and a new
framework that has a chance of becoming the next big thing. You don't need to be
an expert in everything that comes along, but you need to be open to trying it
out.

One of the best things you can do for yourself is to foster a love of
learning. When you finish your respective program, assuming you've worked as
hard as you can, there is a good chance you'll be a serviceable developer. But
to become an expert, you'll have to want to teach yourself. As you look for
work, make it clear to your prospective employers that one of your chief
motivations is the pure joy associated with learning something new.

Now, having a better attitude about why you're getting into programming is all
well and good, but it's still not going help you land a job if all you're doing
is submitting resumes through company job boards. Why should they hire you rather
than someone whose spent the last four years working on a computer science
degree? It's a fair question, and one which could very well prevent you from
getting in the door.

One of the best things you can do for yourself is get to know people in the
community, and work to gain their respect. These people are the connections
you can lean on when it comes time to find a job. Companies depend on their own
employees to help them find new hires; if you can have informal conversations on
a regular basis with employees of a company you're interested in, there's
a great chance they'll be willing to help you score an all important interview.

Once you're in the door, you've got as good a chance as anyone of getting a job.
Focus on what you're good at, and understand that for your employer, it's going
to be more important to find out how you work than what you know. Soft skills
can be really helpful here, so if you struggle with communication, take the time
while your in your program to work on improving this.

Many of the companies you interview with won't offer you jobs, but don't let it
get you down. There are a ton of potential positions out there, and it takes
time to find places that might be a good fit. Remember, you haven't failed if
you haven't given up, you just haven't succeeded yet.
